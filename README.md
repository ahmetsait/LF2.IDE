LF2.IDE
=======
A Visual Editor for LF2 Data Files

So what exactly LF2 is?
-----------------------
It's a 2D fighting game that made by Marti Wong & Starsky Wong. See [Official Website](http://lf2.net)

Google 'lf2' for a lot more info. 

But what "LF2" means then?
--------------------------
It means "Little Fighter 2".

What LF2.IDE does with the game?
--------------------------------
A lot of things. First, you should know that LF2 game is so extensible that you can change the whole game as you wish - unless you want to change game logic itself, you need some super special hex-edit skills for that.
You can edit game characters, weapons, levels, even create your own ones and add them to the game.

Why would I need this to edit the game?
---------------------------------------
Because the data files are encrypted and you would propably don't want to do these yourself:
* Decrypt data files to a plain text file
* Open it
* Edit as you wish
* Decrypt it back
* Open the game by double-clicking it to see if everthing works fine

LF2.IDE does all these (except checking if the code works in the game but you can set a shortcut for opening it) also it provides a lot of useful feature like syntax highlighting, auto code completion, visual helpers and a lot more that you can see if you take a look at...
